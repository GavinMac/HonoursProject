# Behaviour Rank System

This Windows forms application uses Microsoft's Speech.Recognition library and NAudio to try and work out possible player behaviour based on language input and microphone input volume.

**Disclaimer:** Please be aware, this system makes use of language detection for vulgar words. The code contains some language that may cause offense as that is the point. For testing purposes, the words "negative" and "bad word" are classed as negative language, and the word "positive" is used for positive language.
